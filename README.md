# Audio Genre Classification API

## Overview

This repository contains a FastAPI-based web service for classifying audio genres using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The API can handle audio files in multiple formats and predict the genre of the audio clip.

## Features

- **Support for Multiple Formats**: The API can process WAV, MP3, and M4A audio files.
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Librosa**: For audio signal processing and feature extraction.
- **Pre-trained CNN**: A convolutional neural network model for genre classification.
